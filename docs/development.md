#ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=true
#ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER=true

STUN_PORT=3478

# ====================================
# CUSTOMIZATION
# ====================================

[... add rest of sample.env here ...]
```

- you can than start it with \
  `$ ./scripts/compose up -d`
- view the logs with \
  `$ ./scripts/compose logs -f`
- and access the API via \
  https://mconf.github.io/api-mate/#server=https://10.7.7.1/bigbluebutton/api&sharedSecret=SuperSecret
    * At some point your browser will warn you about an invalid certificate, but you can press _"Accept the Risk and Continue" / "Proceed to 10.7.7.1 (unsafe)"_

## Notes
- Joining a room via Greenlight currently leads to a "401 session not found" error (see https://github.com/alangecker/bigbluebutton-docker/issues/66). Use the API Mate instead

## Changes
- After doing some changes you usually must...
  * rebuild the image(s): \
    `$ ./scripts/compose build [containername]`
  * restart changes image(s): \
    `$ ./scripts/compose up -d`
